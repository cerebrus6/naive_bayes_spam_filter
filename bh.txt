Good evening po, I'm here because I saw your comment that's looking for a boarding house near UP Cebu.
I have a friend that is in need of "kahati", "katunga", or "someone to pay half" of the rent. Here's the details po.

- Gorordo Ave. Near J&J at the side of UP Cebu
- Room is 2k per person
- 1 CR with overall 3 students that will use it
- 1 Kitchen
- Water is 150 per month
- Every room has a submeter

Just private message Hannah Allysa Tizon or me if you are interested. Have a nice day.
